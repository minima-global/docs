Cookies can be disabled or controlled by setting a preference within User’s web browser or on User’s device. Thus, if User does not want information to be collected through the use of cookies, User can restrict or limit the use of cookies at the individual browser or device level. However, if User chooses to disable cookies some features of the Services may not function properly or Minima may not be able to customize the delivery of information to User.2f:T40b,7.5 Transfer of Ownership: User’s Personal Data may be disclosed and/or transferred upon change of control as a result of a sale of all or a substantial portion of Minima’s assets or stock, merger, acquisition or reorganization, including any due diligence process carried out in relation to the same, provided that the Personal Data disclosed continues to be used solely for the purposes permitted by, and subject to the provisions in, this Privacy Policy by the entity acquiring access to such information. If the entire or substantial ownership of Minima or Services were to change, User’s Personal Data may be transferred to the new owner to ensure continuity of the Services. In any such transfer of ownership User’s Personal Data will remain subject to the promises of the then and current Privacy Policy. Minima will provide reasonable advance notice to User via the Website of any such change in ownership or control of User’s Personal Data or in case such Personal Data becomes subject to a different privacy policy.30:T478,10.5 The Services may include links to, or otherwise direct User’s attention towards, websites operated by third parties and not by Minima. Such links are provided solely for User’s convenience and informational purposes. The inclusion of any link does not imply an association, support, endorsement, consent, examination, or approval by Minima of such third party and third-party website (including without limitation any content on such website). Minima shall not be liable for the information and content contained in any third-party website or for User’s use of or incapacity to use such website. Access to any third-party website is at User’s own risk, and User must be aware of the fact that linked websites have terms and privacy policies different from those of Minima and Minima does not control them. If User elects to use any third-party website and/or provide any Personal Data when using such website, User is solely responsible for evaluating the terms and privacy policy that apply. Minima will have no liability for any loss or damage that User may incur through providing any Personal Data on such third-party websites.31:T584,13.2 Personal Data Safeguards: Minima is committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and security of the Personal Data of Users. Minima employs advanced security techniques to safeguard Personal Data against unauthorized access, use and/or disclosure. Minima strictly restricts access to Personal Data in accordance with specific internal procedures governing access to such information. Minima carefully selects the individuals privileged with access to Personal Data in accordance with internal security policies and practices, and each such individual is bound by confidentiality obligations. The Services ensure secure communications with TLS encryption. To maintain the security of online sessions and protect Minima’s systems from unauthorized access, Minima uses a combination of firewall barriers, encryption techniques and authentication procedures, among others. Access to Minima’s systems requires multiple levels of authentication, including biometric recognition procedures. Security personnel monitor the systems 24/7. Minima databases are both physically and logically protected from general employee access. Minima enforces physical controls on its premises. Minima is routinely verified for its use of encryption technologies and audited for its privacy practices. Minima tests its systems, the Website and Services infrastructure for any failure points that might allow hacking.32:T463,14.1 If a security breach causes an unauthorized intrusion into Minima’s systems, software or networks that leads to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, Personal Data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed by Minima (“Personal Data Breach”), Minima will notify the appropriate data protection authority unless the Personal Data Breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of affected Users. Minima will report the Personal Data Breach to the appropriate data protection authority without undue delay after having become aware of it and in any case within the timeframes as provided for in the applicable Data Protection Laws, by including all the pertinent information relating to such Personal Data Breach as required by the applicable Data Protection Laws. When the Personal Data Breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of affected Users, or if required by the appropriate data protection authority, Minima will also communicate the Personal Data Breach to the affected Users without undue delay.33:T479,15.1 Minima reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time in order to reflect changes in the Services or the applicable laws. If Minima decides to change this Privacy Policy in the future, Minima will post an appropriate notice at the top of this Privacy Policy page and/or give reasonable advance notice to Users through the Services or Website. Any non-material change (such as clarifications) to this Privacy Policy will become effective on the date the change is posted and any material changes will become effective thirty (30) days from their posting on the Website. Unless stated otherwise, this Privacy Policy applies to all Personal Data collected and processed by Minima in connection with the Services. The date this Privacy Policy was last revised appears at the top of this document. User is advised to print a copy of this Privacy Policy for reference and revisit this Privacy Policy from time to time to ensure that User is aware of any changes. User’s continued use of the Services after the changes to this Privacy Policy become effective signifies User’s acceptance of any such changes.2:["$","$L18",null,{"toc":[{"title":"1.
