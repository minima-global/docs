The Minima MDS (MiniDapp System) Library is a TypeScript implementation of the MDS interface for building MiniDapps. This library can be used when building frontend application 

<Callout type="info" title="Info">
The TypeScript library is available for use in the browser and Node.js and is currently in development.

## Getting Started

Setup the MDS library for your project using your preferred package manager.


<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}>
  <Tab value="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install @minima-global/mds
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add @minima-global/mds
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add @minima-global/mds
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="bun">
    ```bash
    bun add @minima-global/mds
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Usage

The `MDS.init()` function is used to initialize the MDS library and handle events from the MDS.

You get access to the `event` and `data` parameters which you can use to respond to events from the MDS.

```typescript title="example.ts"
import { MDS } from "@minima-global/mds";

MDS.init(async ({ event, data }) => {
  // Handle events from the MDS
})
```

You can check the `event` parameter to determine which event has been triggered and handle the event accordingly.

```typescript title="example.ts"
import { MDS, MinimaEvents } from "@minima-global/mds"; // [!code highlight] 

MDS.init(async ({ event, data }) => {
  if (event === MinimaEvents.INITED) {  
    console.log("MDS Initialized and ready ðŸš€")
  } 
})
```

All Minima CLI commands are available as methods on the `MDS.cmd` object. To see the full list of commands available see the [Terminal Commands](/docs/development/terminal-commands) page.

You can use the `MDS.cmd` object to send commands and get access to the response by either using the `await` keyword or by passing a callback function.

```typescript title="example.ts"
import { MDS, MinimaEvents } from "@minima-global/mds";

// using async/await
MDS.init(async ({ event, data }) => {
  if (event === MinimaEvents.INITED) {
    const command = await MDS.cmd.block() // [!code highlight] 
    console.log(command.response.block) // [!code highlight]
  } 
})

// using callback
MDS.init(({ event, data }) => {
  if (event === MinimaEvents.INITED) {
    MDS.cmd.block((data) => { // [!code highlight]
      console.log(data.response.block) // [!code highlight]
    }) // [!code highlight]
  }
})
```


The `params` object is used to pass type safe parameters to the command.

```typescript title="example.ts"
import { MDS, MinimaEvents } from "@minima-global/mds";

const MX_ADDRESS = "MxG086K6127VBG29AW0RUF0F1QGZZ0J3M3ZFYF4FWZMR1R49Y7ZPVR9V7916PGN" // [!code highlight]

MDS.init(async ({ event, data }) => {
  if (event === MinimaEvents.INITED) {
    const command = await MDS.cmd.send({ // [!code highlight]
      params: { // [!code highlight]
        address: MX_ADDRESS, // [!code highlight]
        amount: 100 // [!code highlight]
      } // [!code highlight]
    }) // [!code highlight]
  }
})
```

## Types 

The MDS library uses TypeScript to provide type safety for the parameters and response data for each command.

To import the types for a command you can use the following syntax:

```typescript title="example.ts"
import type { Block } from "@minima-global/mds";
```

Example of the `MDS.cmd.block()` return types:

```typescript title="example.ts"
import { MDS, type MDSResponse, type Block } from "@minima-global/mds";

const command = await MDS.cmd.block()

// command is typed as :
type Command = MDSResponse<Block>

// command.response is typed as :
type Response = Block

```

All responses from the MDS are typed using the `MDSResponse` type and include the following properties:

 - `command`: The command that was sent to the MDS.
 - `params`: The parameters that were sent to the command.
 - `pending`: Whether the command is pending.
 - `status`: Whether the command was successful.
 - `error`: An error message if the command failed.
 - `pendinguid`: The pending UID if the command is pending.
 - `response`: The response data for the command.


Where the `response` property is inferred from the command that was sent.
