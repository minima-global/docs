This simple contract allows you to send funds to a contract that only allows a certain amount to be withdrawn over a period of time. There are more complex variants.

```bash
IF @COINAGE LT 10000 THEN RETURN FALSE ENDIF
ASSERT SIGNEDBY ( 0xOwnerPublicKey ) AND VERIFYOUT(@INPUT @ADDRESS @AMOUNT*0.9 @TOKENID TRUE)
```

This allows the owner to withdraw 10% every 10000 blocks, forever. It never stops.
