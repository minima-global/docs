The most common contract in Minima is one that returns TRUE if signed by a single public key.

When you use the `send` or `getaddress` functionality this is the address that is automatically created either to receive the funds or the change address.

You can view your current default addresses with `keys` and your custom scripts with `scripts`.

If you need help with the parameters - use `help`

A default script in Minima: `RETURN SIGNEDBY(0xFFEE67F7C..)`
