For developers, Minima provides a unique environment for producing exciting decentralized applications, pushing the boundaries of modern day technology.

This section includes tutorials on constructing transactions, MiniDapps and smart contracts.

Minima is unique in its offering in that it provides:

- borderless, peer-to-peer transfer of value (Minima blockchain)
- borderless, peer-to-peer communication (Maxima)
- a simple platform for running web apps locally from a node (MiniDapp System)
- a simple but comprehensive, turing-complete scripting language for Smart contracts (KISS VM)
- native functionality for tokenisation and NFTs
- a layer 2 solution for scaling applications

Minima does not provide:

- any central server storing a database of information

## How to build on Minima

There is no “right” way to create decentralized applications on Minima. You may choose your own path and technologies that you are most comfortable using.

It is likely more desirable and of interest to build dApps to be as decentralised as possible which is what Minima facilitates by having complete nodes on mobile devices. **Pure sovereignty over your data.**

As developers, we must be extra creative while developing MiniDapps, considering efficient methods to distribute and store data, lower power usage, and grant the smoothest user experience.

## Required Knowledge

If you haven't already, we recommend you gain a thorough understanding of the Minima Protocol by reading the [Knowledge base](/docs/learn).


## Prerequisities

There are no special hardware requirements for building a MiniDapp.

Before you start to create MiniDapps, you will need a code editor to write your code, for example [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), but this is your own preference.
