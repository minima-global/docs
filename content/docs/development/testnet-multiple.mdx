At its core, Minima is a Java application, so first make sure you have Java installed. Download from [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

You will need the latest release of the minima.jar file which can be downloaded from GitHub [here](https://github.com/minima-global/Minima/releases)

We will be using a server or desktop command line interface (CLI) to start Minima.

## 1. Start the genesis node

1. Create a new folder and copy the minima.jar into that folder. We will run everything from there.
2. Copy the path to the file and from the command line, `cd` into that folder
3. Enter the following command

**Node 1:**

```bash title="Terminal"
java -jar minima.jar -data minidata1 -basefolder minidata1 -genesis -test -nop2p -mdsenable -mdspassword [INSERT NODE1 PASSWORD]
```

- Replace placeholder `[INSERT NODE1 PASSWORD]` with a custom password for your node 1

This will start a node on the default ports of 9001-5.

Check your balance with `balance`.

## 2. Start the second node

We create a second node to test transactions between two nodes, note that we will need to:

- remove the `-genesis` parameter,
- change the data and base folders,
- add the `-port` parameter to start it on a different port,
- add the `-connect 127.0.0.1:9001` parameter to connect this node to the genesis node.

**Node 2:**

1. Open a new command line window and enter the following command

```bash title="Terminal"
java -jar minima.jar -data minidata2 -basefolder minidata2 -test -nop2p -mdsenable -mdspassword [INSERT NODE2 PASSWORD] -port 10001 -connect 127.0.0.1:9001
```

- Replace placeholder `[INSERT NODE2 PASSWORD]` with a custom password for your node 2
- Optionally set a port of your choice, we use 10001 here

**You should now have two nodes up and running that are connected to eachother! **

## Restarting the nodes

You can shutdown the nodes by running `quit` from the command line window.

To **restart** the same node from where you left off, re run the command for either node above **removing the `-genesis` parameter for node 1.**

To **delete** the data and start a new clean nodes, re run the command for each node adding the `-clean` parameter.

**ALL DATA WILL BE LOST AND A NEW SEED PHRASE WILL BE GENERATED.**

## Restarting the node

You can shutdown the node by running `quit` from the command line window.

To **restart** the same node from where you left off, re run the command above **removing the `-genesis` parameter. **

```bash title="Terminal"
java -jar minima.jar -data minidata -basefolder minidata -test -nop2p -mdsenable -mdspassword [INSERT PASSWORD]
```

To **delete** the data and start a new clean node, re run the command from step 3 above, adding the `-clean` parameter.

<Callout type="warn">
  **WARNING!** The `-clean` parameter will delete all data and start a new fresh
  node. **ALL DATA WILL BE LOST AND A NEW SEED PHRASE WILL BE GENERATED.**

</Callout>

```bash title="Terminal"
java -jar minima.jar -data minidata -basefolder minidata -genesis -test -nop2p -mdsenable -mdspassword [INSERT PASSWORD] -clean
```

## Start up parameters

<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="What do the paramaters mean?">
  
- `-data [foldername/path]` : the data folder where all the config files for this node are stored. Default is a hidden .minima folder under the user's home directory. If you want to specify a folder not in the user's home directory, you must use the complete path.
- `-basefolder [foldername/path]` : specify a default file creation / backup / restore folder. Default is the user's home directory. Can be the same as the data folder provided.
- `-genesis` : delete all old data and start the node from the genesis block
- `-nop2p` : Disable the automatic P2P system
- `-test` : this uses test settings which have a faster blocktime and only keep a shorter chain in memory. If you are compiling Minima yourself you can edit these to your needs.
- `-mdsenable` : start the MiniDapp system
- `-mdspassword` : set the password to login to the MiniDapp system
- `-port` : set the starting port
- `-connect [ip:port]` : Disable the automatic P2P system and create your own network by manually connecting to this list of host:port

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Optional startup paramaters">
The following start up parameters can optionally be specified when starting your Docker node.

<Callout>
  To add/remove parameters after a node has been started, you must `quit` the
  node and restart it, adding/removing the required parameters. `[]` square
  brackets indicate where an input is required, **the brackets should not be
  included.**
</Callout>

<Heading as="h4">General</Heading>

- `-clean` : CAREFUL! Clears existing data, starts a new fresh node. All coins will be lost.
- `-port [port]` : specify the initial port for Minima to use. Range used will be the specified port +4. Default is 9001-9005.
- `-host [ipaddress]` : specify the host IP
- `-dbpassword [yourdbpassword]` : Main Wallet / SQL AES password - MUST be specified on first launch. **CANNOT be changed later.**
- `-allowallip` : Allow all IPs for Maxima / Networking. Local IPs won't be allowed otherwise.

- `-daemon` : Run in daemon mode with no stdin input (if running Minima as a background service)
- `-isclient` : Tells the P2P System that this node can't accept incoming connections
- `-server` : Use Server settings - this node can accept incoming connections
- `-desktop` : Use Desktop settings - this node can't accept incoming connections

<Heading as="h4">Folders</Heading>

- `-data [foldername/path]` : the data folder where all the config files for this node are stored. Default is a hidden .minima folder under the user's home directory. If you want to specify a folder not in the user's home directory, you must use the complete path.
- `-basefolder [foldername/path]` : specify a default file creation / backup / restore folder. Default is the user's home directory. Can be the same as the `data` folder provided.
