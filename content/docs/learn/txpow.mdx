The TxPoW unit is the main building block of the Minima Blockchain.
Transactions are included in TxPoW units which have the potential to become blocks added to the chain.

## Witness

A Witness provides three proofs that prove a transaction is valid. Each proof is stored in an MMR tree. It has the following attributes:

## TxBlocks (Blocks)

TxBlocks are TxPoW that become blocks and get added to the blockchain. TxBlocks can also be referred to as SyncBlocks as they are required for syncing when a new user joins (or existing users rejoin) the network.

They include the following details:

| TxBlock Attribute | Description                                                                 | Type                   |
