Users who are running a Mega node are able to set up a Web Wallet interface for users who are not able to run a node themselves.

A Web Wallet can only be enabled on [Mega nodes](/docs/run-a-node/mega-node) with the MiniDapp System (MDS) enabled.

## What is a Web Wallet?

A Web Wallet allows any user to hold, send, and receive native Minima and other custom tokens or NFTs created on Minima, in a non-custodial wallet.

On accessing a Web Wallet, the user can generate a secret key which they must write down and keep secure - this effectively acts as the seed phrase to their funds.

Logging in with their secret, a user will be provided with a native Minima wallet address for their personal use.

Users of a Web Wallet are able to login to any Web Wallet with their secret key, however we only recommend always using the same node from a trusted provider. Using the same Web Wallet every time also ensures the user's key uses are counted accurately.

## How to start a Web Wallet

As a Mega node runner, you must first ensure that:

- You have a Mega node running on a server with a public facing IP address
- You have either performed a chain resync from an archive node, or imported a Mega MMR file from another Mega node runner. This is essential to ensure the node is tracking all available coins and to support any potential user of your Web Wallet.

To enable the Web Wallet, run the following command from the Terminal MiniDapp:

```
mds action:publicmds enable:true
```

You will then be required to accept the pending command from the Pending MiniDapp.

Once enabled, navigate to https://yourserverIP:9003/publicmds/ to access your Web Wallet interface.


## How to set a custom session ID 

You can set your own Session ID for the Public MDS by adding the `-publicmdsuid` start up parameter to your Mega node.
