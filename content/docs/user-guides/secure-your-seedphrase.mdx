Keeping your wallet secure involves:

- Keeping the device your node is running on secure.
- Writing down your seed phrase **immediately after starting your node.**
- Locking your node with a password. See [Locking your node](/docs/user-guides/security/lock-your-wallet).
- Backing up your node. See [Backing up your node](/docs/user-guides/security/backup-your-wallet).

Your seed phrase will be required to restore your wallet if you lose access to your node and do not have a backup. It can be found in the Security MiniDapp.

 - **DO** use a metal plate to record your seed phrase and store it somewhere safe
 - **DO** Make 2 copies of your seed phrase and give one to a trusted relative or store in a second location
