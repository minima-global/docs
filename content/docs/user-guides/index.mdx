## Desktop

If you are using the JNLP on desktop, simply click on the `Launch MinimaOS` button or go to https://127.0.0.1:9003/ in your web browser. If you have any trouble logging in, close the window and restart Minima.

Similarly, if using docker desktop go to https://127.0.0.1:9003/

If you installed Minima on a different port to 9001, your login page can be accessed from this base port +2.

## Server

Access your login screen by going to https://YourserverIP:9003/

**We recommend configuring your server's firewall to only having the mds port (9003) accessible from your home IP address.**

## Android - Desktop connect

Android users can connect to their phone node from a computer that is connected to the same WiFi network.
