title: Add Minima to Your Exchange
description: MEG user guides
tag: user-guides
---

The Wallet API allows you to perform simple Wallet functionality for any number of users.

This does NOT access the main wallet of the Minima node and does not save any of the private keys or data.

Each API Endpoint requires certain parameters and can be sent as a POST or GET request.

## Recommended setup

When providing custodial wallet solutions for users, we highly recommend a dual-node setup, using an offline node for signing transactions and an online Mega MMR node for constructing and posting transactions, and any other actions that require on-chain information. 

You will also need a USB or other method to transfer the unsigned/signed transaction files between devices.

We assume that no keys will be stored on either the online node or the offline node. Accounts (wallets) can be generated from the offline Minima node and keys stored securely elsewhere.

## Pre-requisites

For the following tutorials, you will need:

1. An online Mega MMR Minima node - this ensures the node is recording all coin proofs required for transactions.

2. An online instance of MEG running.

For setup instructions, see the <a href="https://docs.minima.global/docs/run-a-node/meg-setup" target="_blank">MEG Setup</a> page.

3. An API user created in MEG 

4. (Optional) An offline Minima node with RPC enabled

5. (Optional) An offline instance of MEG running


## How to create a new wallet

Generating wallets can optionally be done from a Minima node that is offline, ensuring that the private keys are never hot. 

**You will need to securely store all generated Wallet details and key uses for your users. This information will not be stored on the node and will not be shown again.**

To create a new wallet with a secure random seed phrase, use the following Wallet API endpoint:

```
/wallet/create
```

Example:
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/wallet/create -X POST --user api:123
```

The response contains 

| Response field         | Description                                        |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `seedphrase`   | the generated seed phrase                          |
| `privatekey`   | the associated private key                         |
| `modifier`      | the modifier (salt) used                           |
| `publickey`    | the associated public key                          |
| `script`        | the script associated with the address             |
| `address`       | 0x address for receiving funds                   |
| `miniaddress`  | Mx address for receiving funds                   |

<Callout title="0x or Mx address?">
 Either the `0x` or `Mx` address can be used to receive funds, however it is recommended to use the Mx address as this contains a checksum which is checked before a transaction is executed.
</Callout>

## How to create a wallet from a seed phrase

Alternatively, to create a wallet with your chosen seed phrase, use the following Wallet API endpoint and provide `seedphrase` as a parameter: 

```
/wallet/seedphrase
``` 

Example:
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/wallet/seedphrase -d "seedphrase=ORBIT LUXURY EXCHANGE GUN DETECT PALACE AWKWARD TOMORROW ADVICE SPOON RUG BOUNCE VIVID CHERRY ENEMY SOUND BREAD COCONUT ENFORCE TALK CATCH WANT VERIFY TWENTY" -X POST --user api:123
```

**You will need to securely store these details for your users. This information will not be stored on the node and will not be shown again.**


## How to check the balance of an address

To check the balance of a wallet that you have created, use the following Wallet API endpoint and provide `address` as a parameter.

```
/wallet/balance
```

Example:
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/wallet/balance -d "address=MxG086U24F17MT50Y6VUPBPD6VJKTYVMR71WRSYURYUVZDN1VMG25FF39M0458A" -X POST --user api:123
```

The response contains

| Response field         | Description                                        |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `token`      | name of the token                                                                                                              |
| `tokenid`    | tokenid of the token                                                                                                           |

| `coins`      | the total number of coins (UTxOs) that make up the balance                                                                     |
| `total`      | the total supply of Minima                                                                                                     |

## How to send from a wallet (online)

To send an amount from a wallet that you have created, use the following Wallet API endpoint:

```
/wallet/send
```

And provide the following parameters:

| Parameter          | Description                                                                                             |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tokenid`     | TokenID of the token (defaults to Minima - 0x00)                                                      |
| `amount`      | Amount to send                                                                                          |
| `toaddress`   | Address to send to                                                                                      |
| `fromaddress` | Address to send from (provided when creating the wallet)                                               |
| `privatekey`  | Private Key of the FROM Address (provided when creating the wallet)                                    |
| `script`      | The script of the FROM Address (provided when creating the wallet)                                     |
| `keyuses`     | The number of times this address has been used (nonce)                                                |
| `burn`        | Transaction Burn / Fee (optional)                                                                       |



Example

```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/wallet/send -d "tokenid=0x00&amount=0.01&toaddress=MxG080M5PYA0ZQG59YG9W106SEBD8FPAWATFTN8B1NNW6EW8KJYCCEDD2RP4G1A&fromaddress=MxG086U24F17MT50Y6VUPBPD6VJKTYVMR71WRSYURYUVZDN1VMG25FF39M0458A&privatekey=0xAA49...&script=RETURN SIGNEDBY(0xC79AA2E9D0FF21DD27A28717C3EB63737DE98931E46173B9227EAA7A1A2F8677)&keyuses=1&burn=0.01" -X POST --user api:123
```

From the response, you can capture the txpowid (i.e. the transaction id), which can then be checked to see when it is on-chain.

<Callout type="warn" title="Block number for the transaction">
You should ignore the `block` number in the response from the send command, this is the block number that the txpow was attempting to become, NOT the block that the transaction is in.
</Callout>


### How to set the Key Uses

When sending or signing with the Wallet API a keyuses(nonce) value is required. It must be increased each time the same private key is used. It must be a number between 1- 262,144.

For functions where `keyuses` is a parameter, you can specify your own value by providing the `keyuses` parameter or use the value stored by MEG by providing the `publickey` parameter.

To store the latest `keyuses` in the database, you must provide both the `keyuses` and `publickey` parameters. 

The actual keyuses database file can be found in the data folder `nonce.mv.db`. You can backup and reuse this file if you install MEG on another server.

OR - you can set the MINIMUM nonce value to a high enough value without copying the database by using the `-minkeyuses` param when starting MEG.

The current MAX value for all keyuses is displayed on the Admin page.


## How to check an on-chain transaction or block (online)

Once a transaction or block has been posted, you can check its block number and number of block confirmations it has on-chain. 

This can only be done for as long as you have set the `-txpowdbstore` start up parameter. If not using this startup parameter, this check must be performed within the first 24 hours from the time of the transaction or block, then it is pruned.

Use the `checktxpow` Wallet API endpoint, providing the `txpowid` of the transaction as a parameter - this can be found in the response from `send`, `posttxn` or `minetxn`) 

```
/wallet/checktxpow
```

Example
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/wallet/checktxpow -d "txpowid=0x0000170771B9339A3A80DD1B3450E932F7C4054414AC6FACA5376D83E71062F1" -X POST --user api:123
```

The response contains 
| Response field            | Description                                                                  |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `found`         | was the transaction found on chain?                                         |
| `block`         | the block number that the transaction is in                                 |
| `blockid`       | the block hash that the transaction is in                                   |
| `tip`           | the current top block                                                       |
| `confirmations` | the number of block confirmations for the transaction                       |


## How to get transaction or block (txpow) details (online)

Once a transaction or block has been posted, you can retrieve the details of the transaction or block from the node using its txpowid. 

This can only be done for as long as you have set the `-txpowdbstore` start up parameter. If not using this start up parameter, this check must be performed within the first 48 hours from the time of the transaction or block, then it is pruned.

To get the transaction or block details, use `gettxpow` Wallet API endpoint, providing the `txpowid` of the transaction or block as a parameter - this can be found in the response from `send`, `posttxn` or `minetxn`) 

```
/wallet/gettxpow
```

Example:
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/wallet/gettxpow -d "txpowid=0x0000170771B9339A3A80DD1B3450E932F7C4054414AC6FACA5376D83E71062F1" -X POST --user api:123
```

The response contains the full txpow unit details.

## How to estimate the burn

Minima does not require payment of fees to miners, however the burn is used to prioritize transactions in the mempool if blocks are full.

To find out recent on-chain burn metrics, create an endpoint for the `burn` function which displays min, max, avg and median burn for the last 1, 10 and 50 blocks. 


## How to manage UTxOs

Since Minima is a UTXO-based blockchain, it is important to consolidate coins frequently to ensure the running of the node is efficient.

The consolidate function allows you to join multiple UTxOs, creating 10 equal value coins.

For example, if you have 100 coins, you can consolidate using `maxcoins:50` and this will consolidate 50 coins into 10, leaving a total of 60 coins. 

```
/wallet/consolidate
```

Providing the following parameters:

| Parameter          | Description                                                                                             |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tokenid` | TokenID of the token (defaults to Minima) |
| `fromaddress` | Address to send from AND back to |
| `privatekey` | Private Key of the FROM Address |
| `script` | The script of the FROM Address |
| `burn` | Transaction Burn / Fee (optional) |
| `maxcoins` | How many coins to consolidate (optional - defaults to 50) |
| `keyuses` | The number of times this address has been used (nonce) |
| `publickey` | Use the keyuses value MEG stores for this public key |

Note: Either provide your own value for `keyuses` or provide the `publickey` and MEG will find the keyuses. If you provide both values MEG will store the keyuses value in the DB.


Example:
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/wallet/consolidate -d "tokenid=0x00&fromaddress=MxG08...&privatekey=0xAA49...&script=RETURN SIGNEDBY(0xC79A...)&burn=0.01&maxcoins=50&keyuses=1&publickey=0xC79A..." -X POST --user api:123
```

The response contains the full transaction.


## Example transactions

The most secure method for creating & signing transactions is to create the transaction from an online node, transfer the transaction data (via USB for example) to an offline node for signing and then post the transaction from an online node. 

### Example 1 : Automatic coin selection

The following example explains how to construct, sign and post a transaction where the coin inputs are automatically selected. 

This only uses endpoints provided by the wallet API.

The required endpoints are as follows:

<Steps>
<Step>

**(Optional) Lock coins**

Node status: Online

If you intend to create multiple transactions from the same address without posting them, you can lock the coins  - this prevents the same coins being used in more than one unposted transaction. Once you have finished creating unsigned transactions, you can unlock the coins. 

```
/wallet/lockcoins
```

</Step>
<Step>

**Create unsigned transaction**

Node status: Online

This endpoint creates an unsigned transaction with automatic coin selection based on the amount and burn. The coin proofs are added to the transaction at this stage. 

```
/wallet/unsignedtxn
```

Please refer to the Wallet API page in MEG for the relevant parameters. 


<Callout title="Conditions for posting the transaction">
This transaction must be posted within 24 hours to ensure the coinproofs are valid.
</Callout>

The response provides the data that must be signed with an online or offline node. 

</Step>
<Step>

**Sign the transaction**

Using the data provided from the `unsignedtxn` response, you must sign the transaction, providing the private key associated with the `fromaddress`.

<Callout title="Key Uses">
Note that keyuses should be incremented each time the same private key is used to sign a transaction. See [How to set key uses](/docs/user-guides/meg/meg-wallet-api#how-to-set-the-key-uses)
</Callout>

Node status: Online/Offline

```
/wallet/signtxn
```

Example

```bash title="Terminal"
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/wallet/signtxn -d "data=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privatekey=0xAA49...&keyuses=2" -X POST --user api:123
```

The response will provide the data that is required for mining and posting the transaction.

</Step>
<Step>

**Mine and Post the transaction**

**Option 1: Mine and Post the transaction simultaneously**

Node status: Online

Post and mine the transaction simultaneously, providing the data from the `signtxn` response as a parameter. 

`/wallet/posttxn`

The response will provide the `txpowid` that you can subsequently use to track the transaction. 


**Option 2: Mine and Post the transaction separately**

1. ALTERNATIVELY, you can mine the transaction first to get the correct txpowid without posting the transaction to the network, providing the data from the `signtxn` response as a parameter. 

Node status: Online/Offline

```
/wallet/minetxn
```

2. To then post a pre-mined transaction to the network, use the following endpoint, providing the data from the `minetxn` response. 

Node status: Online

```
/wallet/postminedtxn
```

</Step>
<Step>


**Unlock the coins**

You can repeat step 2 to create as many unsigned transactions from the same address as required, without posting them.

Once you have finished creating unsigned transactions, you can unlock the coins. 

Node status: Online

`/wallet/unlockcoins`

</Step>
<Step>

**Check the transaction is on-chain**

Within 24 hours of the transaction being posted, you can check the block number it is in and number of block confirmations it has on-chain.

Use following Wallet API endpoint, providing the `txpowid` of the transaction as a parameter - this can be found in the response from `send`, `posttxn` or `minetxn`) 

Node status: Online

### Example 2 : Custom coin selection

The following example explains how to construct, sign and post a transaction with coin inputs of your choice.

This only uses endpoints provided by the Wallet API.

The required steps are as follows:

<Steps>
<Step>

**Get a list of coins**

To spend from a specific address, search for the list of coins relevant to the address.

Node status: Online

```
 /wallet/listcoins
```


Example:
```bash title="Terminal"
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/wallet/listcoins -d "address=MxG086U24F17MT50Y6VUPBPD6VJKTYVMR71WRSYURYUVZDN1VMG25FF39M0458A" -X POST --user api:123
```

The response contains a list of coins with:

| Response           | Description                                               |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `coinid`       | the unique id of the coin                                 |
| `amount`       | the value of the coin                                     |
| `address`      | the 0x address of the coin                                |
| `miniaddress`  | the Mx address of the coin                                |
| `token`        | the token name (if not Minima)                            |
| `tokenid`      | the tokenid of the coin (0x00 is Minima)                  |
| `storestate`   | true if the coin is storing the state                     |
| `state`        | the state variables stored in the coin                    |
| `spent`        | is the coin spent?                                        |
| `mmrentry`     | the entry number of the coin in the mmr                   |
| `created`      | blocktime that the coin was created in                    |
| `age`          | how many blocks deep the coin is in the chain             |

</Step>
<Step>

**Construct a transaction**

You can manually construct a transaction, providing a comma separated list of input coins. You will have to calculate how much to send (toamount) and how much change to return to the fromaddress. 

<Callout title="Inputs/Outputs" Type="warn">
If the toamount + changeamount < coin amount , the remaining amount will be burned. 
</Callout>

Node status: Online

```
/wallet/constructtxn
```

Example:
Note: This coin has a balance of 0.08, the toamount is 0.05 and the changeamount is 0.02, therefore 0.01 will be set as the burn amount.

```bash title="Terminal"
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/wallet/constructtxn -d "tokenid=0x00&coinlist=0xF57C0E43B92B6E3E416B7FC55DC4681A1E56A4771C7918D2F3A6C1A858F9E543&toamount=0.05&toaddress=MxG080M5PYA0ZQG59YG9W106SEBD8FPAWATFTN8B1NNW6EW8KJYCCEDD2RP4G1A&fromaddress=MxG086U24F17MT50Y6VUPBPD6VJKTYVMR71WRSYURYUVZDN1VMG25FF39M0458A&changeaddress=MxG086U24F17MT50Y6VUPBPD6VJKTYVMR71WRSYURYUVZDN1VMG25FF39M0458A&changeamount=0.02&script=RETURN SIGNEDBY(0xC79AA2E9D0FF21DD27A28717C3EB63737DE98931E46173B9227EAA7A1A2F8677)" -X POST --user api:123
```

This transaction must be posted within 24 hours to ensure the coin proofs are valid.
The response provides the data that must be signed with an online or offline node. 

</Step>
<Step>

**Sign the transaction**

Node status: Online/Offline

```
/wallet/signtxn
```

Using the data provided from the `unsignedtxn` response, you must sign the transaction, providing the private key associated with the `fromaddress`.

<Callout title="Key Uses">
Note that keyuses should be incremented each time the same private key is used to sign a transaction. See [How to set key uses](/docs/user-guides/meg/meg-wallet-api#how-to-set-the-key-uses)
</Callout>

Example

```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/wallet/signtxn -d "data=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privatekey=0xAA49...&keyuses=2" -X POST --user api:123
```

The response will provide the data that is required for mining and posting the transaction.

</Step>
<Step>

**Mine and Post the transaction**

**Option 1: Mine and Post the transaction simultaneously**

Node status: Online

Post and mine the transaction simultaneously, providing the data from the `signtxn` response as a parameter. 

`/wallet/posttxn`

The response will provide the `txpowid` that you can subsequently use to track the transaction. 


**Option 2: Mine and Post the transaction separately**

1. ALTERNATIVELY, you can mine the transaction first to get the correct txpowid without posting the transaction to the network, providing the data from the `signtxn` response as a parameter. 

Node status: Online/Offline

```
/wallet/minetxn
```

2. To then post a pre-mined transaction to the network, use the following endpoint, providing the data from the `minetxn` response. 

Node status: Online

```
/wallet/postminedtxn
```

The transaction will be posted to the network.

</Step>
<Step>

**Check the transaction is on-chain**

Within 24 hours of the transaction being posted, you can check the block number it is in and number of block confirmations it has on-chain.

Use following Wallet API endpoint, providing the `txpowid` of the transaction as a parameter - this can be found in the response from `send`, `posttxn` or `minetxn`) 

Node status: Online

```
/wallet/checktxpow
```


</Step>
</Steps>

## MySQL setup (Optional)

REPLACE WITH LINK TO MYSQL PAGE

We recommend setting up a connection from your Minima node to a MySQL database for the purpose of recording and storing full block history that is automatically pruned from the node after 12 hours. 
This way you can always query your SQL database for transactions. 
Download and install MySQL
Create a database called archivedb on a port of your choice
Create a user archiveuser with full access to archivedb
Check the connection from the Minima node to the database using the following command into the Minima terminal 

mysql host:127.0.0.1:3306 user:archiveuser password:archiveuserpassword database:archivedb action:info

You should see an output similar to the following:
```
{
  "command":"mysql",
  "params":{
    "host":"127.0.0.1:3306",
    "user":"archiveuser",
    "password":"archiveuserpassword",
    "database":"archivedb",
    "action":"info"
  },
  "status":true,
  "pending":false,
  "response":{
    "archive":{
      "archivestart":860695,
      "archiveend":960695,
      "archivetotal":100000
    },
    "mysql":{
      "mysqlstart":-1,
      "mysqlend":-1,
      "mysqltotal":0
    },
    "autobackup":false
  }
}
```

Set autobackups on, this will periodically sync blocks and txpow data from the node to the SQL database.

```
mysql host:127.0.0.1:3306 user:archiveuser password:archiveuserpassword database:archivedb action:autobackup enable:true
```

You should see an output similar to the following, with autobackup set to true.
```
{
  "command":"mysql",
  "params":{
    "host":"127.0.0.1:3306",
    "user":"archiveuser",
    "password":"archiveuserpassword",
    "database":"archivedb",
    "action":"autobackup",
    "enable":"true"
  },
  "status":true,
  "pending":false,
  "response":{
    "autobackup":true
  }
}
```
The first backup will take place within 24 hours.
Then to query for a specific txpow (block), you can use
mysql ..LOGIN_DETAILS.. action:findtxpow txpowid:0x00FFEEDD.. */}
