When using MiniDapps that have READ permission, you will need to **accept or deny** any transactions or sensitive commands they trigger from the **Pending** MiniDapp.

To review and accept or deny pending commands:

1. Open the **Pending** MiniDapp.
2. All actions awaiting approval will be listed in the order they were triggered.
3. Review each command and select **Approve** to run the command or **Deny** to stop the command and remove it from the list.
4. If your wallet if locked, you may be prompted to enter your password when approving a command.
