## Resync from MySQL

If a user has been offline for too long and cannot resync to the chain from the IBD alone, or has lost access to their node, they can connect to a MySQL database to perform a chain or seed resync, provided it is publicly accessible.

This is an alternative option to re-syncing from an archive node.

As with archive nodes, there are two options when using a MySQL database to re-sync your a node:

- `Chain re-sync:` If a user has been offline for too long and their node is not on the correct tip block, they can re-sync to the latest block by performing a [chain re-sync](#to-perform-a-chain-re-sync) from a MySQL database. **The node will NOT be wiped during this process.**
- `Seed re-sync:` If a user does not have a valid backup or has lost access to their node, they can restore access to their coins by performing a [seed re-sync](#to-perform-a-seed-re-sync) from a MySQL database using their 24 word seed phrase. **The node will first be wiped before the re-sync begins.**

<Callout title="Info">
To re-sync using credentials for a read-only user,  set the `user` and `password` parameters as the credentials for the read-only user you have set up in MySQL, and add `readonly:true` as a parameter in the following commands.
</Callout>

### To perform a chain re-sync

1. On the node requiring a re-sync, check the connection to the MySQL database, changing the ip:port as required

```bash title="Terminal"
mysql host:127.0.0.1:3307 database:archivedb user:archiveuser password:youruserpassword action:info
```

2. To start the chain re-sync, run

```bash title="Terminal"
mysql host:mysqlhost:port database:archivedb user:archiveuser password:youruserpassword action:resync
```

Your coins will remain safe throughout this process. Once complete, you will be on the correct tip block.

### To perform a seed re-sync

1. On the node requiring a re-sync, connect to check the MySQL archive database

```bash title="Terminal"
mysql host:127.0.0.1:3307 database:archivedb user:archiveuser password:youruserpassword action:info
```

2. To start the seed re-sync, run

```bash title="Terminal"
mysql host:mysqlhost:port database:archivedb user:archiveuser password:youruserpassword action:resync phrase:\"24 WORDS HERE\"
```

Optionally set the number of keys and keyuses relevant to you. If not specified, the defaults are keys:80 and keyuses:1000

```bash title="Terminal"
mysql host:mysqlhost:port database:archivedb user:archiveuser password:youruserpassword action:resync phrase:\"24 WORDS HERE\" keys:90 keyuses:2000
```

## Check an address history

To check the unspent and spent coins for an address, run 

```bash title="Terminal"
mysql host:127.0.0.1:3307 database:archivedb user:archiveuser password:youruserpassword action:addresscheck address:0x79...
```
