The official [Web Wallet](https://wallet.minima.global) provides a non-custodial Minima wallet for those who are unable to run their own Minima node. 

The Web Wallet provides you with a native Minima wallet address and allows you to send, receive, and store Minima, custom tokens, and NFTs.

On first use, you will generate a secret key. **Keep this key secure, as it will not be shown again after logging out. Losing this key means losing access to your assets.** No private data is stored or recorded by Minima.

For future access, log in using this same secret key.

If in future, you decide to run your own Minima node, simply send your assets to your new node wallet address.

<Callout type="warn" title="Unofficial Web Wallets">
If you prefer not to use the official Web Wallet and are unable to run your own node, you may ask someone running a Minima node on a server to [set up a web wallet](/docs/user-guides/mega-node/host-a-public-wallet) on your behalf. However, always exercise cautionâ€”websites can be compromised or manipulated, so only use wallet providers you know and trust.

Generate a new 16 character secret key by clicking on "Generate Secret Key".

</Step>

<Step>

</Step>

<Step>
**Navigate to the Receive tab to see your wallet address**

Copy your Mx wallet address or scan the QR code. This can be shared and is the address you can receive native Minima or custom tokens / NFTs that have been created on the Minima blockchain to.
