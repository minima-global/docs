To achieve Minima's vision of complete decentralisation, there are no centralised servers that control access to the network. Therefore, when running a node for the first time, you will need one or more connections to join the network.

To get a list of connections, use one of the following methods:

- ask another node runner to [share their connections](#sharing-connections) with you
- enter `/minimapeers` into any channel in our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/minimaglobal)
- Google search for **minimapeers.txt**
- use a public URL that returns a list of Minima peers, for example https://www.spartacusrex.com/minimapeers.txt

**This is a one off task, only required when starting a node for the first time.**

  If you are restoring a backup to a new node, select "I'll do this later" and
  continue to restore your backup using the Security MiniDapp.

## Adding connections

Connections (or 'peers') are simply other nodes that can share the blockchain with new users, enabling them to join the network.

**To add connections for the first time:**

<Steps> 
<Step>
<Heading as="h3">Settings</Heading>

From the Home screen, go to **Settings**.

![settings](/img/runanode/settingsicon.jpg)

</Step>

<Step>
<Heading as="h3">Add connections</Heading>

Select **Add connections**.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/runanode/addconnectionssetting.jpg"
  alt="add connections"
  width="500"
  height="500"
/>

</Step>

<Step>
<Heading as="h3">Enter connections</Heading>

Paste the list or URL into the box and select **Add connections**

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/runanode/addconnections2.jpg"
  alt="connections"
  width="500"
  height="500"
/>

</Step>

<Step>

<Heading as="h3"> Check your block number </Heading>

Exit the Settings and wait a few minutes for the block number to appear in the top right

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/runanode/blocknum.jpg"
  alt="block number"
  width="500"
  height="500"
/>

</Step>

</Steps>

That's it! You are now connected to the network!

Once you have joined the network, ensure you [write down your seed phrase](/docs/user-guides/seedphrase).

## Sharing connections

To help a new user join the network, share your connection list with them.

<Steps>
<Step>
<Heading as="h3">Settings</Heading>

From the Home screen, go to **Settings**.

![settings](/img/runanode/settingsicon.jpg)

</Step>

<Step>
<Heading as="h3">Share Connections</Heading>

From there select **Share connections**.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/runanode/connectionssetting.jpg"
  alt="share connections"
  width="500"
  height="500"
/>

</Step>

<Step>

<Heading as="h3">Share the connections</Heading>

Select **Copy** to copy the list of connections. You can then send the list to a new node runner.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Add/Share via the Terminal

Alternatively, you can add or share connections using the Terminal

**To add connections:**

```bash title="Terminal"
   peers action:addpeers peerslist:[IP:PORT],[IP:PORT],[IP:PORT] ...
```

**To share connections:**

```bash title="Terminal"
   peers action:list max:10
```
