## Installation

At it's core, Minima is a Java application. So on a server or CLI the easiest way to run Minima is to install Java and download the latest minima.jar.

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
  You can download the latest version of Minima from the [Minima GitHub releases
  page](https://github.com/minima-global/Minima/releases).

The latest version is `v1.0.41`.

To run Minima, you need to have Java installed on your system. You can check if you have Java installed by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash title="Terminal"
java -version
```

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
  If you don't have Java installed, you can download it from the [Java
  website](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

 When you first run Minima the first thing you need is to add some connections.
