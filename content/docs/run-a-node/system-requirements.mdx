Minima is a lightweight blockchain that can be run on any Android device (version 9 or above), general purpose computer or server (VPS).

There is no minimum amount of Minima coins required to run a node.

The following information is for Server or Desktop users.

## Minimum hardware requirement

The following requirements are separate to any specs required for non Minima related processes. GPU is not necessary.

### Standard full node

<Callout title="Minidapps" type="warn">
  High MiniDapp usage may require higher availability of Storage
</Callout>

- Processing: 2 CPU
- Memory: 2GB RAM
- Storage: 2GB storage

<Callout title="Docker" type="warn">
  Processing, memory and storage require 4 CPU, 4GB RAM and 4GB storage if using
  Docker.
</Callout>

### Archive node

- Processing: 2 CPU (4 CPU if using Docker)
- Memory: 4GB RAM
- Storage: 5GB storage

<Callout title="Storage" type="warn">
  Minimum requirements for storage may change over time.
</Callout>

### Mega node

- Processing: 2 CPU
- Memory: 8GB RAM
- Storage: 5GB storage

<Callout title="Android" type="error">
  We do not recommend running a Mega node from an Android device as the RAM
  consumption is considerably higher than a standard node.
</Callout>

The Mega node must be online constantly to remain in sync with the chain. Downtime of less than 24 hours is acceptable.

## Ports used

By default, Minima reserves ports `9001-9005`, although an alternate 5-port range can be chosen by specifying a different main port on start up e.g. 8001.

```bash title="Terminal"
java -jar minima.jar -port 8001
```

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
  If specifying a different main port e.g. 8001, the port range used will be the
  next consecutive 4 ports. e.g 8001-8005.
</Callout>

- **9001 TCP (main port):** The main Minima port, for peer-to-peer communication over Minima and Maxima
- **9002 TCP(or main port +1):** Not currently used
- **9003 TCP(or main port +2):** MiniDapp System (MDS) Web Server
- **9004 TCP(or main port +3):** No longer used after v 1.0.37
- **9005 TCP(or main port +4):** JSON-RPC over HTTP

Desktop nodes are not required to configure any port forwarding to use Minima.

## Recommended Firewall settings (VPS users)

<Callout title="Docker" type="error">
  If using Docker to run your node on a VPS, you must not rely on UFW as your
  firewall, Docker will overwrite UFW firewall rules. You must use your VPS
  provider's firewall manager.
</Callout>

After configuring your firewall, you should check they are enforced as expected.

### Ingress

All inbound connections should be denied by default.

**22 tcp:** allow all

Allows ssh access to the server, optionally only allow this from your home IP address.

**9001 tcp:** allow all

<Callout title="9001 - Relay nodes" type="info">
  Allowing inbound connections on port 9001 will ensure your node acts as a
  relay node. Relay nodes are the backbone of the Minima peer-to-peer network
  that faciliate the transmission of transactions and blocks across the network
  and support the network to scale. If your inbound connection is closed, your
  node will only make outgoing connections and will not act as a relay node.
</Callout>

**9003 tcp:**

- if enabling the MiniDapp system, **allow only from your home IP address**
- if running Minima headlessly, **deny inbound connections**

<Callout title="9003 - Minidapp port" type="info">
  If your home IP is dynamic, you will need to maintain this firewall rule to
  your latest IP. If you choose to allow inbound connections from anywhere, your
  login screen will be public facing, so your login password (mdspassword) must
  be long and secure, using a combination of lowercase, uppercase letters
  numbers and symbols.
</Callout>

**9002 tcp (not in use):** deny all

**9004 tcp (not in use):** deny all

**9005 tcp (RPC port):**

- deny all, or
- if you want to `curl` into the node remotely, ensure this is **only allowed inbound from your home IP address. You should only do this if you are an advanced user and understand the risks!**

<Callout type="error">
  Opening port 9005 is extremely risky as it exposes your node and seed phrase
  if you have not set a [secure password for RPC access](/docs/run-a-node/linux-vps-system#rpc-client-setup).
</Callout>
