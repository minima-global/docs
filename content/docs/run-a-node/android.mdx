   OPPO have a strict background policy which means that even if Minima is allowed to run in the background, it may be force closed if there are too many apps with this permission.

    To ensure that Minima continues to run as expected, please ensure that you have fewer than 5 apps on your phone (including Minima) that are allowed to run in the background.
