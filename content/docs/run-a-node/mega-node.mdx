A Mega node is similar to an Archive node in that that it can recover any Minima user that has lost access to their node or requires a re-sync to the chain.

A Mega node does not also have to be an archive node although the two can be run together on the same node.

What does it do?

A Mega node stores `all unspent` coins with their proofs, this differs to a standard node which only stores the coins (and proofs) that are relevant to the user.

## System requirements

The following requirements are separate to any specs required for non Minima related processes.

- **Processing**: 2 CPU
- **Memory**: 8GB RAM
- **Storage**: 5GB storage

We do not recommend running a Mega node from an Android device as the RAM consumption is considerably higher than a standard node.

The Mega node must be online constantly to remain in sync with the chain. Downtime of less than 24 hours is acceptable.

## Ports

If running an archive node on a desktop, no port forwarding is required.

If running a public archive node on a server, open inbound connections on port 9001 (or the main custom Minima port you have chosen).

## How to start a Mega node

<Steps>
<Step>

### Start (or update) a node

Start (or update) a node in the same way as as a normal node, adding the `-megammr` startup parameter. See examples below.

<Tabs items={["Terminal", "JNLP", "Docker"]}>

<Tab value="Terminal">
 ```bash
java -jar /path/to/minima.jar -mdsenable -mdspassword YOURSECUREPASSWORD -megammr
```

</Tab>

<Tab value="JNLP">

1. Start a node as per the Run a Node section for Windows or Mac.
2. Once running, on the Settings tab, under Advanced Params, tick the "Use custom parameters" box
3. Enter `-megammr`
4. Close the window and restart the node by relaunching the JNLP

</Tab>

<Tab value="Docker">
Start a node as per the Run a Node section for Docker desktop or Linux VPS (Docker). However, when starting the container, add the following environment variable to the start up command:

`-e minima_megammr=true`

If you already have other Minima containers running, you can start a separate Mega node by changing the port

e.g. `-p 6001-6003:9001-9003`

<Tabs items={["Windows","Mac/Linux", "Linux VPS"]}>
<Tab value="Windows">

```bash
docker run -d -e minima_mdspassword=INSERTPASSWORD -e minima_desktop=true -e minima_megammr=true -v C:\Users\INSERTUSERNAME\megaminimadocker:/home/minima/data -p 9001-9003:9001-9003 --restart unless-stopped --name megaminima minimaglobal/minima:latest
```

</Tab>

<Tab value="Mac/Linux">

```bash
docker run -d -e minima_mdspassword=INSERTPASSWORD -e minima_desktop=true -e minima_megammr=true -v ~/megaminimadocker:/home/minima/data -p 9001-9003:9001-9003 --restart unless-stopped --name megaminima minimaglobal/minima:latest
```

</Tab>

### Join the network

Once the node is running, you will need to join the Peer-to-Peer network, enter the following command from the Minima terminal/RPC client:

`peers action:addpeers peerslist:https://spartacusrex.com/minimapeers.txt`

Alternatively use your own list of peers.

You should see the response below, wait a few moments to receive the initial blockchain download.

```json
{
  "command": "peers",
  "params": {
    "action": "addpeers",
    "peerslist": "https://spartacusrex.com/minimapeers.txt"
  },
  "status": true,
  "pending": false,
  "response": {
    "message": "Peers added to checking queue.."
  }
}
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Chain sync or import historical data

A Mega node should be backfilled with the chain history so that the node has a complete database of all the coins since the blockchain started.

Import a MegaMMR `.mmr` file, generated no longer than 1 week ago, from another Mega node runner by running the following command from the Minima Terminal, RPC Client or Terminal MiniDapp.

Daily .mmr exports can be found [here](https://spartacusrex.com/megaarchive/).

```bash title="Terminal"
megammr action:import file:[PathToFile]/megammr.mmr
```

Alternatively, you can [Chain resync](/docs/user-guides/node-recovery/chain-resync) the Mega node from an Archive node,
