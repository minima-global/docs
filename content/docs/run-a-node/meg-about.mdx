Minima E-Gateway (MEG) is a middleware gateway service that enables enterprises, exchanges and developers to integrate with the Minima blockchain.

The primary function of MEG is to support interactions between Minima and other business applications and/or services through a combination of a HTTP/S API and web hooks. MEG operates as a stateless intermediary, enabling interactions without retaining any data.

## System Overview

MEG runs as a separate java program to Minima, and can be deployed easily by setting up the MEG java program as a background service on a single server instance.

The MEG service must be configured to connect to a Minima node via the Minima node's RPC port.

### Single server deployment

A single server deployment scenario is suitable for a sandbox environment supporting a proof of concept, or pilot use case. It can also be used for small standalone production deployments where resource constraints exist or low usage volume is expected.

### Production deployment

To support a large scale and/or high volume, production environments, multiple instances of MEG can be deployed offering high availability and load balancing scenarios.

### Offline deployment

MEG can be used in a secure offline environment with an offline Minima node. This is useful where an offline Minima node is required for signing transactions.

## Event flows

Three types of interactions are supported:

### Triggers

Triggers send HTTP/S based requests to a registered destination endpoint when certain on-chain events occur, for example in response to transactions sourced from a specified address or tokens occurring on the Minima blockchain.
On a 'Trigger' event, a POST request is made with the relevant JSON data to the specified URL.

### Endpoints

Endpoints can be used to initiate transactions or other interactions on the Minima blockchain, in response to a HTTP/S based request sent from a registered client endpoint. Can be configured to use relevant parameters.

### Wallet API

<Callout title="Requires a Mega Node">
  You MUST be running the Minima node with the `-megammr` startup parameter for
  this to work.
</Callout>

The Wallet API includes dedicated endpoints to support custodial wallet functionality for any number of users. This does NOT access the main Wallet of the Minima node and does not save any of the private keys or data. Each API Endpoint requires certain parameters and can be sent as a POST or GET request.

## Start up parameters

The following start up parameters are available for MEG:

| Start up parameter   | Description                                                                             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-port`              | The port to listen on.                                                                  |
| `-data`              | The data folder.                                                                        |
| `-adminpassword`     | The 'admin' User account password (then used to add other accounts).                    |
| `-apicallerpassword` | The 'apicaller' User account password.                                                  |
| `-meghost`           | The `http://host:port` of this instance of MEG.                                         |
| `-minimarpc`         | The `http://host:port` of the Minima RPC.                                               |
| `-minimarpcpassword` | The Minima RPC password if enabled.                                                     |
| `-minkeyuses`        | MINIMUM key uses value for any Public Keys (if you are running this from a new server). |
| `-help`              | Print this help.                                                                        |

## Admin Console

MEG exposes an admin console enabling admin operators to

1. configure triggers (from Minima events)
2. configure custom endpoints
3. view the wallet API endpoints
4. manage MEG users
5. view logs

## Access Control

The admin console enables you to configure 3 types of users: admin, basic and API Caller.

| Role           | Description                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Admin**      | Creates and removes users, adds and removes triggers and endpoints, sets the connection to the Minima node.                         |
| **Basic**      | View-only user access to the console.                                                                                               |
| **API Caller** | Endpoints can only be called by 'apicaller' users using the Basic Authorization Header. Does not grant login access to the console. |

MEG exposes ports to the localhost only. MEG can be positioned behind an API gateway and/or application firewall and due to the nature of its role, interactions should be restricted to authorised and trusted users and systems only.

## Dependencies

MEG requires a Minima node (v1.0.41 or above) to be running with the following parameters

- `-rpcenable`
- `-megammr`
- `-notifyalltxpow`
- `-mysqlalltxpow` (optional)

## Installation steps

1. Download the latest meg.jar and minima.jar files
2. Start a Minima node with the required parameters
3. Start MEG with required parameters
4. Create a connection between MEG and the Minima node
5. Configure the MEG users
6. Configure the required triggers and custom endpoints

Please see [MEG setup](/docs/run-a-node/meg-setup) for details.

## Uninstallation

MEG can be uninstalled by stopping the java program and deleting the MEG data folder (defined on start-up)

### Patching and Upgrades

New releases of MEG are made available on the Minima MEG Github repository.

To upgrade MEG:

1. If required, ensure you have a second instance of MEG running so that no trigger events are missed whilst upgrading.
2. stop MEG
3. replace the MEG java .jar file
4. restart MEG, using the same data folder as previously defined at start up
5. check that the connection to the Minima node remains
