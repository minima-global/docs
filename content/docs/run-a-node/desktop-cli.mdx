<Callout title="Note">
  The following process is for running a Minima node manually. You must leave
  your desktop running at all times for Minima to continue running and must
  update your node manually when new versions become available.
</Callout>

## Start a new Minima node

To run Minima, you need to have Java installed on your system. You can check if you have Java installed by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash title="Terminal"
java -version
```

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
  If you don't have Java installed, you can download it from the [Java
  website](https://www.java.com/en/download/).
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step>

### Download the latest minima.jar

You can download the latest version of Minima from the [Minima GitHub releases
page](https://github.com/minima-global/Minima/releases).

The latest version is `v1.0.41`.

</Step>
<Step>

### Start your node

Type the following command all on one line, replacing `INSERTUSERNAME` with the username for your files and `[insertpasswordhere]` with your own custom password:

<Callout title="Tip">
  To avoid typing in the folder path, you can drag and drop the downloaded
  minima.jar file into the command line window.

<Accordions type="single">
<Accordion title="Startup parameters">
The following start up parameters can optionally be specified when starting your node.

To add/remove parameters after a node has been started, you must `quit` the node and restart it, adding/removing the required parameters.

`[]` square brackets indicate where an input is required, **the brackets should not be included**.

<Callout type="warn" title="Avoid">

The following process is for running a Minima node manually so you should avoid the following:

- Closing the terminal window
- Allowing your PC to go to sleep
- Turning your PC off

If any of the above happen, your Minima node will stop running and you will need to repeat step 3 to start it again.

</Callout>

Minima is now started, your output should look similar to the below and you should start to see the logs running.

```bash
Minima @ 14/03/2022 17:32:30 [5.1 MB] : **********************************************
Minima @ 14/03/2022 17:32:30 [5.1 MB] : *  __  __  ____  _  _  ____  __  __    __    *

Your node is now installed & running!

<Heading as="h4">Secure your node</Heading>
<Card
  title="Security"

/>

</Step>

</Steps>

## Login to your node

The first time accessing your MiniDapp hub, you may need to pass through the security warning - see below - as the MiniDapp system currently uses self-signed certificates.

<Callout type="info" title="Custom Ports">

Note that **9003** is the default port for accessing your MiniDapp system - if you installed Minima on custom ports, you will need to use your custom base port + 2. E.g. If you installed Minima on 8001, you will need to use https://127.0.0.1:8003/

</Callout>

Go to https://127.0.0.1:9003/ in your web browser. You may have to proceed past the security warning, since Minima uses self-signed certificates. Learn how here.

You will see the login page to your node.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/runanode/mds_login.png"
  alt="mds_login"
  width={500}
  height={500}
/>

If you set one, use the password you set as your -mdspassword when starting the node.

<Callout title="Forgot your password?" type="warn">
  To check your password you can return to your desktop command line/terminal
  where the Minima logs are running and enter `mds`
</Callout>

## First steps

The first time you install Minima, you will need to

- Connect to the network
- Write down your seed phrase

<Callout title="User Guides" type="info">
  For more information on how to connect to the network and secure your node,
  please refer to [User Guides](/docs/user-guides/jointhenetwork).
</Callout>

## Using the MiniDapp Hub

By default, all MiniDapps will be given **READ** permission when you install them.

When a MiniDapp with READ permission attempts to run a command which would make changes to your node or require access to your funds, a PENDING command will be created which you will need to accept.

<Callout title="Danger" type="error">
  You should only give WRITE permissions to MiniDapps that you trust. Only the
  Terminal MiniDapp will need WRITE permission so you can approve/deny
  transactions.
</Callout>

### Setting the Terminal permissions to WRITE

<Callout title="Info">
  If your prefer to use the Terminal MiniDapp to execute all commands, you will
  need to set the permissions to WRITE see below.
</Callout>

1. Login to your MiniDapp hub and install the Terminal MiniDapp from the [MiniDapp site](https://minidapps.minima.global/)
2. Return to your desktop command line/terminal and run the `mds` command again (see above) to list your MiniDapps and check their existing permissions
3. You will see the Terminal MiniDapp listed, **copy the uid from YOUR node**

Run the following command in the Command line/Terminal where the Minima logs are running, pasting in YOUR uid:

```bash title="Terminal"
mds action:permission uid:0x02FA22EF2A2A3B0FA01D688A902779E5 trust:write
```

You may now use the Terminal MiniDapp to execute all commands. You will no longer need to use your desktop command line interface/Terminal.

## Node status

The `status` command will show details of your node including version, last block and chain details.

1. Type `status` into the command line/Terminal
2. Check `block` and `time`, this is your tip block and the `time` of that block, time should be within a few minutes of the current time.

<ImageZoom
  src="/img/runanode/docker_vps_terminalstatus.png"
  alt="docker_vps_terminalstatus"
  width={500}
  height={500}
/>

<Callout title="Checking your node is in sync" type="warn">
Having a recent block time is not a guarantee that you are on the right chain.
Consider cross checking your latest block with another node or checking the samechain response of your Maxima Contacts by running the maxcontacts command.

If the time shown is significantly behind, you should restart your node to resync to the chain. If it doesn't catch up automatically, youu may need to perform a chain resync from an Archive node.

</Callout>

**Other useful commands:**

- `mds` - find the password for your node
- `help` - show all commands

## How to update your node

1. Type `quit` into the Command prompt/Terminal window where the Minima logs are running
2. Download the latest version of Minima from the [Minima GitHub releases page](https://github.com/minima-global/Minima/releases) and replace the existing minima.jar file with the latest version
3. Restart Minima using the command in step 2 in [Start a new Minima node](#start-a-new-minima-node).

<Callout title="Starting a clean node">
  To create a fresh install of a node -clean can be added on to the end of the
  start up command DO NOT use -clean if you are simply restarting your node,
  your coins will be wiped and you will only be able to recover them from a
  backup! e.g. java -jar C:\Users\Username\Downloads\minima.jar -mdsenable
  -clean
</Callout>

## How to remove your node

<Callout title="info">
  Removing a node without taking a backup will delete all your coins! Only
  remove a node if you have taken a backup or are running a test node.
</Callout>

1. Type `quit` into the Command prompt/Terminal window where the Minima logs are running
2. Delete the minima.jar file you downloaded
3. (Optional) Remove the minima database files located in your home directory (you may need to show hidden files)

Once your node running, you will need to [join the network](/docs/user-guides/jointhenetwork).
