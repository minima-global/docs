<Callout type="warn" title="Ensure that Minima running">

The following process is for running a Minima node manually from your command line/terminal interface. Closing the terminal window or turning off your computer will stop Minima running.

It is recommended to create a batch file or bash script to start Minima at Startup, otherwise you will have to start Minima manually again.

</Callout>

## Pre-requisites


**1. Check you have Java installed**

To run Minima, you need to have Java installed on your system. Check if you have Java installed by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash title="Terminal"
java -version
```

<Callout title="Java Download" type="info">
  If you don't have Java installed, download it from the [Java
  website](https://www.java.com/en/download/).
</Callout>


**2. Download the latest minima.jar**

Download the latest version of Minima from the [Minima GitHub releases
page](https://github.com/minima-global/Minima/releases).

## Start a new Minima node


1. Create a new folder and copy the minima.jar into that folder. We will run everything from there.
2. Open your command line interface/Terminal 
3. Copy the path to the folder and from the command line, `cd` into that folder

```
cd C:\Users\Bob\MyMinimaFolder\
```

<Callout title="Tip">
  To avoid typing in the folder path, drag and drop the folder into the command line window.
</Callout>

4. Enter the following into the command line window to start Minima

<Tabs items={["With MiniDapps", "Headless - CLI only"]}>
  <Tab value="With MiniDapps">

Set your password for the MiniDapp system by replacing `INSERTPASSWORD` with your own.


```bash title="Terminal"
java -jar minima.jar -data .minima -p2pnodes megammr.minima.global:9001 -mdsenable -mdspassword INSERTPASSWORD
```

  
Minima is now starting, and should automatically join the network. Your output should look similar to the below and you should start to see the logs running.

```bash

```


**Login to your node**

Go to https://127.0.0.1:9003/ in your web browser. You may have to proceed past the security warning, since Minima uses self-signed certificates. Learn how [**here**](https://www.vultr.com/docs/how-to-bypass-the-https-warning-for-self-signed-ssl-tls-certificates/).

You will see the login page to your node.

<Callout type="info" title="Custom Ports">

Note that **9003** is the default port for accessing your MiniDapp system - if running Minima on custom ports, use your custom base port + 2. E.g. If you installed Minima on 8001, use https://127.0.0.1:8003/

### Setting the Terminal permissions to WRITE

<Callout title="Info">
  If your prefer to use the Terminal MiniDapp to execute all commands, you will
  need to set the permissions to WRITE see below.
</Callout>

1. Login to your MiniDapp hub and install the Terminal MiniDapp from the [MiniDapp site](https://minidapps.minima.global/)
2. Return to your desktop command line/terminal and run the `mds` command again (see above) to list your MiniDapps and check their existing permissions
3. You will see the Terminal MiniDapp listed, **copy the uid from YOUR node**

Run the following command in the Command line/Terminal where the Minima logs are running, pasting in YOUR uid:

```bash title="Terminal"
mds action:permission uid:0x02FA22EF2A2A3B0FA01D688A902779E5 trust:write
```

You may now use the Terminal MiniDapp to execute all commands. You will no longer need to use your desktop command line interface/Terminal. */}


## How to update your node

1. Type `quit` into the Command prompt/Terminal window where the Minima logs are running
2. Download the latest version of Minima from the [Minima GitHub releases page](https://github.com/minima-global/Minima/releases) and replace the existing minima.jar file with the latest version
3. Restart Minima as above

<Callout title="Starting a clean node">
  To create a fresh install of a node -clean can be added on to the end of the
  start up command DO NOT use -clean if you are simply restarting your node,
  your coins will be wiped and you will only be able to recover them from a
  backup! e.g. java -jar C:\Users\Username\Downloads\minima.jar -mdsenable
  -clean
</Callout>

## How to remove your node

<Callout type="warn" title="Write down your seed phrase">
  Removing a node without taking a backup will result in losing access to your coins. Only
  remove a node if you have taken a backup or written down your 24 word seed phrase.
</Callout>

1. Type `quit` into the Command prompt/Terminal window where the Minima logs are running
2. Delete the minima.jar file you downloaded
3. Remove the minima database files located in your home directory or the directory you specified at startup with the `-data` parameter (you may need to show hidden files)

Once your node running, you will need to [join the network](/docs/user-guides/join-the-network).
