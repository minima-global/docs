No matter which node type you choose, **all Minima nodes are full nodes** that contribute to finding new blocks, validate all transactions, and provide Proof of Work to secure the chain.

Running a node means that you will run
1. **The Minima Blockchain** - to make and receive transactions to other users
2. **Maxima** - to send messages and data to other users
3. **The MiniDapp System (MDS**) - to use decentralised applications 
4. **Omnia (Coming soon)** - for fast, cheap transactions

-------------

**The following node types are available:**

1. **Full nodes** - The default and best option for Android users. Ideal for regular users who want to participate in the Minima network without worrying about significant storage or technical requirements.

**The following node types use more disk space and processing power but can provide additional use cases by storing more of the chain history:**

2. **Mega MMR nodes** - Ideal for those who have access to a server and wish to assist others in the recovery of their nodes or host a Minima node for use by others.

3. **Archive nodes** -  Ideal for those who wish to hold a record of all previous block headers. Archive nodes will not prune blocks after 2 months.

<Callout title="Relay nodes">All types of nodes can contribute further to the network's health and resilience by relaying transactions and blocks across the network. This requires the node to be hosted on a server that accepts both incoming and outgoing connections on the base port (default 9001).</Callout>

Before taking a closer look at the differences between these node types, it's useful to consider an analogy:

*If all the coins in the Minima blockchain were a in book, every user would only hold the page that relates to them, as well as the spine. When making a transaction, the user provides their page and other users can check that it fits with their spine, this is how they confirm that the user's transaction is valid.*


## Full node (default)

**Ease of setup:** Easy<br></br>
**Hardware requirements:** Low

A full node can run on almost any device â€” be it a mobile phone, desktop computer, raspberry pi, or a server.

This is the default node type designed for efficiency. It is perfect for everyday users and small devices wishing to utilise the Minima network. It uses the least amount of memory as possible, making it ideal for devices with limited storage. 

**Transaction history:** Full nodes store only the most recent transaction history in full, roughly the last 24 hours' worth. It prunes older blocks to keep the storage space minimal but keeps a compact record of the pruned history, called the Cascade, to ensure it can validate transactions and create new blocks. <br></br>
Users keep a record of their own full transaction history which can be backed up or exported. 

**Coin records:** Full nodes only hold the proofs for the coins that are relevant to the user (i.e. their own page in the book), keeping storage and processing requirements minimal. 

**Additional functionality** 

- Optionally automatically sync block and transaction data to an external MySQL database

## Mega (MMR) Node

**Ease of setup:** Advanced <br></br>
**Hardware requirements:** High

A Mega MMR Node requires a server or other device with more considerable processing power and is not suitable for mobile devices.

**Transaction history:** Same as a default full node.

**Coin records:** While it doesn't keep every detail of every transaction ever made, it stores all the proofs needed to verify any coin on the network. This is the entire set of unspent coins for the whole blockchain (i.e. all pages in the book). Known as the Mega MMR. 

**Additional functionality** 

If run on a public facing server, Mega MMR nodes can be used to:
- automatically sync block and transaction data to an external MySQL database
- quickly recover other users if they have lost access to their node (and therefore their coins).
- host public facing MiniDapps

**Setup steps:**
1. Start a node with Mega MMR enabled
2. Sync from another Mega MMR or Archive node which contains the full history


## Archive node

**Ease of setup:** Advanced <br></br>
**Hardware requirements:** High


An Archive Node is typically run on a server or desktop computer as it requires more storage space.

**Transaction history:** Unlike the default full node, an archive node does not prune older blocks, storing all block headers and coin proofs from the moment it was started. Full transaction details are still pruned after two months.

**Coins:** It maintains a complete MMR database of the coins since the archive node was started, meaning it has proofs for more coins, not just the ones relevant to a single user. If the archive node is resynced from the Genesis block, it will hold a complete record of the coins. 

**Additional functionality** 

- automatically sync block and transaction data to an external MySQL database
- export the chain history required for syncing new Archive or Mega MMR nodes 

**Setup steps:**
1. Start a node with Mega MMR enabled
2. Sync from another Archive node which contains the full history


## Choosing the Right Node for You

**Just Getting Started?** Stick with the default Full Node. It's easy to set up and doesn't demand much from your device.

**Want to Support the Network More?** Consider hosting a Mega MMR node and relaying transactions by allowing incoming connections. You'll contribute to the network's resilience and help other users recover their nodes.
