## Allocation Overview

Minima has a hard-capped supply of 1 billion coins, that will slowly reduce over time as a result of [The Burn](/docs/learn#the-burn). 

All coins were minted at the Token Generation Event and allocated within the following categories:

## Token Generation Event (TGE)

100% of Native Minima (1,000,000,000 $MINIMA coins) were minted at the Token Generation Event, and 12.5% of these coins are wrapped on the Ethereum blockchain as ERC-20 tokens (125,000,000 $WMINIMA coins). This was done to enable Wrapped Minima to be tradable on exchanges shortly after  TGE in Q1 2023,  ahead of the native $MINIMA integration on CEXS, and to enable possible future usecases requiring an ERC-20.

Wrapped Minima ($WMINIMA) can always be exchanged 1:1 with Native Minima ($MINIMA) with the Minima Treasury.

Native Minima (875,000,000 $MINIMA coins) are available to trade peer-to-peer via the MiniSwap MiniDapp and on CEXs once the necessary integration has been implemented, expected Q3/Q4 2024.

| | Supply | Process |
|:------------|:------------------|:------------------|
|**Total Minima** |  1,000,000,000 |Minted at TGE |
|**Wrapped Minima ($WMINIMA)** |  125,000,000 |Wrapped as ERC-20 tokens|
|**Native Minima ($MINIMA)** | 875,000,000 |Native Minima for circulation |

## Slowing Down Circulating Supply

Having listened  to our Community and in consultation with our largest holders and backers, we have worked to reduce the circulating supply compared to that of the pre-TGE tokenomics.   The updated total circulating supply at the time of the planned Native Listing (c. 18 months post TGE -  Q3/Q4 2024) has been reduced to 34%, as opposed to 67% under the pre-TGE Tokenomics.  This represents a significant 55% reduction in circulating supply.  2 years post-TGE the supply will be 43% and 3 years post-TGE the supply will be 63%, representing a 50% and 35% reduction in supply across the two years respectively.

This has been achieved through signed agreements, and includes increasing the lockups for major backers to 27 months with a linear unlock and moving the release of the full supply back further to 6 years post-TGE.

For comparison, these table demonstrates the change from our pre-TGE tokenomics to our updated post-TGE tokenomics:

|:-------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|

|**Reduction in Circ Supply from Pre-TGE Tokenomics** |  |  | 55% | 50% | 36% | 33% | 20% | 12% | 0% |


As can be seen in the chart below, this significantly reduces the circulating supply of Native Minima well into the future.

*updated vesting schedules (overall lock up within this round)

## Public Rewards
15% of Minima's total supply (150,000,000 coins) is allocated to Public Rewards.

Node Incentives were distributed via an Incentive Program that rewarded early community members for running a node, alongside an Invite Program, which rewarded members for inviting new members to join.

Rewards earned by Incentive Program members were distributed as Native Minima ($MINIMA). An additional 75 coins were available for Incentive Program members who continued to run their node 6 months after the TGE, and a further 75 coins were available at the 1-year anniversary of the TGE.

### Maximize

Users can earn a yield on their native Minima coins via the fully collatoralized, non-custodial MiniDapp Maximize. Yield is in the form of native Minima, paid to participants who lock up their holdings for set periods of time - encouraging continued node running and reducing the total circulating supply of Minima while creating genuine demand for coins. [Click here](/docs/core/minidapp-terms#g-1-maximize-minidapp) for more information on Maximize.

### Ecosystem Growth

34.63% of Minima's total supply (340,630,000 coins) is allocated to Ecosystem Growth.

The purpose of this category is to support, maintain and improve Minima, through marketing and business development as well as providing grants and incentives that benefit the project with the overall aim to ensure the network remains completely decentralized over time. 

## Grants & Bounties

Grants are available for building interesting and novel use cases on Minima. They will be awarded to developers and entrepreneurs, in collaboration with a range of Minima partners, to accelerate the growth of the network.

Bounties are also available for individuals who discover critical bugs and report them to the team [via Discord](https://discord.gg/minimaglobal), before anyone else.
