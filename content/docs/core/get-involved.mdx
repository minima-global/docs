## Running a Node

Start by [running your own Minima node](/docs/run-a-node)!

You will get a non-custodial native Minima wallet; a suite of of default MiniDapps to start using; and direct access to the blockchain.

Once up and running, you can participate by interacting in the community, and using the social MiniDapps like Chatter. Simply [set up your profile](/docs/user-guides/set-your-profile) and then [share your contact address](/docs/user-guides/maxima/maxima-contacts) with other users.

## Building MiniDapps

If youâ€™re a developer, check out the [Developer Section](/docs/development) of our docs to learn about how to build your own MiniDapps and how to write smart contracts on Minima.

## Purchasing Minima

Minima has a native currency, MINIMA, which has a hard-capped supply of 1 billion coins. 12.5% of this supply is available to purchase as wrapped MINIMA (WMINIMA) on the Ethereum blockchain.

MINIMA (native Minima):

- the native currency of the Minima blockchain,
- lives on the Minima chain and can only be held in a wallet that runs on a Minima node,
- expected to be available to purchase on exchanges in 2024.

WMINIMA (wrapped Minima):

- the wrapped version of native MINIMA that lives on the Ethereum blockchain,
- can be traded on a 1:1 basis with native MINIMA,
- currently available to purchase from [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x0d8c1e8d8b591d8b4d4e7e1d2f4e4efb3f2f4f4f) or [MEXC](https://www.mexc.com/).

### How do I see WMINIMA in Metamask?

If you have purchased WMINIMA and are holding it in a Metamask wallet, WMINIMA needs to be [added as a custom token](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-How-to-display-tokens-in-MetaMask#h_01FWH492CHY60HWPC28RW0872H) in MetaMask before you can view your balance.

The WMINIMA contract address is: `0x669c01CAF0eDcaD7c2b8Dc771474aD937A7CA4AF`.
