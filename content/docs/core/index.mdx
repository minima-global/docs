As the only decentralised layer 1 blockchain lightweight enough to run entirely on mobile and IoT (Internet of Things) silicon chips - and versatile enough to scale across almost any physical device - Minima is unique in its ability to provide Web3 based infrastructure, providing everyday solutions on everyday devices.

Minima provides utility beyond what is already possible, on a completely decentralised blockchain. Additionally including a secure, peer-to-peer messaging system - Maxima - which enables decentralised transfer of information.

Minima’s technology is compact, quantum-resistant, and secured by every single device on the network.

## Why Minima?

Blockchain technology promises decentralization and freedom, but many existing blockchains have run into serious issues that limit their potential for real-world use. 

### Problem 1: Separation of users from block producers

**Why it’s a Problem:**  

In all other blockchains, a separation of users, validators and block producers has arisen:

**Block Producers:** The entities - mining pools and large stakers - responsible for creating new blocks and deciding which transactions to include. This is the stage at which transactions are selected to go on chain and is the fundamental role which should always remain decentralized to avoid attack by selective transaction processing.

**Validators:** Entities that check whether block producers are following the rules and help relay transactions across the network. Note however, that excluding transactions is not a violation of the rules - an attack that validators cannot prevent. 

**Users:** Regular end users who depend on validators to broadcast their transactions and on block producers to include them in blocks.

This structure has created a dynamic where end users are dependent on a small minority of block producers, who control the final say on which transactions are processed. Even though validators help enforce rules, they don’t have the power to include transactions in blocks, leading to a risk of censorship and control by the block producers.

**How Minima Solves It:** 

Minima removes this separation by making every user a validator and a block producer - there is no separation. This means that every user or device running Minima has equal power in the network. On Minima, each device acts as a fully validating and constructing node with the ability to verify transactions and participate equally in block creation. 

This is made possible by 
- making the blockchain compact enough to run on mobile devices, laptops and even chip
- removing incentives of centralization i.e. financial reward for block production

This brings **true decentralization**, with every user cooperating, rather than competing - to help build and secure the network, ensuring fairness and resilience.

Our philosophy is that is the pinnacle that should not be compromised.

### Problem 2: Scalability Issues 

**Why it’s a Problem:**  
Big blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum have struggled to scale up. As more people use them, they become slow and expensive, making small transactions impractical. Various solutions crop up in the form of layer 2s and side chains at the expense of security.

**How Minima Solves It:**  
Minima is built to be efficient and lightweight, allowing fast, low-cost transactions even with lots of users. This makes it ideal for applications that need high speed and volume, without sacrificing accessibility or affordability.

### Problem 3: Complexity in Development

**Why it’s a Problem:**  
Some blockchains require developers to learn complex and highly specialized coding languages, making it difficult for the average developer to jump in. This creates a barrier to innovation, as only a few have the expertise needed to create applications on these networks.

**How Minima Solves It:**  
Minima’s KISS (Keep It Simple, Smart) Virtual Machine offers a straightforward, beginner-friendly environment for building on the blockchain. This simplicity means more people can create applications without specialized knowledge, opening up the field to a broader audience.

### Problem 4: Environmental Concerns

**Why it’s a Problem:**  
Traditional blockchains like Bitcoin use Proof-of-Work (PoW), which requires huge amounts of computing power and energy, contributing to environmental concerns. This makes blockchain technology less sustainable and eco-friendly.

**How Minima Solves It:**  
Minima is designed with a low-power consensus mechanism that’s environmentally conscious. It minimizes resource use without compromising security, making it a much greener option.

---

### Problem 5: Lack of Accessibility and Interoperability

**Why it’s a Problem:**  
Some blockchains are difficult to access and often isolated from other systems, making it hard for new users to participate and for developers to integrate blockchain across platforms. This limits blockchain's accessibility and usability.

**How Minima Solves It:**  
Minima is designed to run on any device—smartphones included—making blockchain accessible to anyone with an internet connection. This ease of access supports interoperability and helps bring blockchain into everyday use.

## Who is Minima for?

Minima primarily caters to four groups, creating value for each in different ways:

**Enterprises** benefit by deploying Minima's lightweight and versatile nodes that naturally scale for an increasing user base and reduce infrastructure costs.

**Decentralised Physical Infrastructure Networks** (DePINs) that build on Minima can quickly prove the value or concept of their project before building and scaling on Minima.

**Developers** benefit from open source code, easy-to-create decentralised applications (MiniDapps), comprehensive documentation and support materials.

**Individuals** interested in decentralised and trustless payments can start a Minima node and launch projects, tokenise real-world assets, and participate in constructing and validating blocks.


With Minima, blockchain becomes decentralized, scalable, eco-friendly, and easy to use, empowering both individuals and developers to participate freely.
