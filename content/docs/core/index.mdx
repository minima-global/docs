Minima is more than a blockchain - it is the bridge between the problems of the real world and the current solutions offered by Web3. It is a connected community of over 50,000 node users and developers that are empowered to solve real-world problems at scale without sacrificing decentralisation or security.

As the only decentralised layer 1 blockchain lightweight enough to run entirely on mobile and IoT (Internet of Things) silicon chips - and versatile enough to scale across almost any physical device - Minima is unique in its ability to provide Web3 based infrastructure, providing everyday solutions on everyday devices.

Minima provides utility beyond what is already possible on a completely decentralised blockchain; additionally including a secure, peer-to-peer messaging system - Maxima - which enables decentralised transfer of information.

Minimaâ€™s technology is compact, quantum-resistant, and secured by every single user on the network.

## Who is Minima for?

Minima primarily caters to four groups, creating value for each in different ways:

**Enterprises** benefit by deploying Minima's lightweight and versatile nodes that naturally scale for an increasing user base and reduce infrastructure costs.

**Decentralised Physical Infrastructure Networks** (DePINs) that build on Minima can quickly prove the value or concept of their project before building and scaling on Minima.

**Developers** benefit from open source code, easy-to-create decentralised applications (MiniDapps), comprehensive documentation and support materials.

**Individuals** interested in decentralised and trustless payments can start a Minima node and launch projects, tokenise real-world assets, and participate in constructing and validating blocks.
